## Our program

**Directions:**

<div align='center'>
As a group, your job is to make a simple program for class! Make a Jupyter notebook that contains a Python program that does Something™. What's Something™? Write a program with the following attributes:
<br />
It takes a name input
<br />
It takes some other input
<br />
It does Something™ with this other input
</div>

Our program will be a number guessing game. The user will input 2 numbers, the first is the range (0 to n) where the user will try to guess. The second number will be the players guess.
