## Instructions

_As a group, your job is to make a simple program for class! Make a Jupyter notebook that contains a Python program that does Something™. What's Something™? Write a program with the following attributes:_
- _It takes a name input_
- _It takes some other input_
- _It does Something™ with this other input_

## Use

Our program generates a random number between 0 and n, an integer inputted from the user. The user will then continually guess for the random number until their guess correctly matches the random number. Once the guess is correct, an output is produced revealing the random number and the amount of guesses the user took.

## Installation

If your machine allows you to use Jupyter you can run the program from `script.ipynb` otherwise you may use Python to run the program using `script.py`. Requires Python 3.7+.
